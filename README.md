This is a basic bash script that demonstrates how to automate a process on a linux OS.

To overcome this error when running the script: "./my_test_script.sh: Permission denied" I ran the following code to make the file executable on my 
mac:

"chmod +x my_test_script.sh"

Then I reran the shell script:

"./my_test_script.sh"


This was done for practice using Linux commands.

cat was used to read files
stat was used for details
echo was used to print content
touch was used to create files
nano was ued to edit files
